# WP-CLI

We created an WP-CLI commands for all the features of the Eightshift-Libs.

## Develop
You can run these commands by mocking them in the tests.

## Boilerplate
You can run this command to show all available commands in WordPress env:

```wp boilerplate --help```

Quick note: please check if `boilerplate` is the correct command parent. This is defined in your project inside the `functions.php` file.
