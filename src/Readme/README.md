## Installation

The project is built using [eightshift-boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate), [eightshift-libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs), and [eightshift-frontend-libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs).

The project uses PRS-4 autoloading and follows PSR-12 coding standards. Until the DevOps set up the staging site, all the features should be merged to `staging` branch.
